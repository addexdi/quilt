# Features

Quilt gives you a toolbox full of useful utilities for creating web applications, services, and packages. We’ve written extensive guides to help you get the most out of the tools you’ll be using most often.

- Learn how to [route to different pages based on the URL](./routing.md) and advanced routing-related tasks, like preloading future routes.
- Learn how to interact with the [HTML document](./html.md) from a Quilt app, including how to add `<title>`, `<link>`, and `<meta>` elements to the `<head>` of your page, and how to serialize data from server to client.
- Learn how your React application can read and write [HTTP-related values](./http.md) like HTTP headers, status codes, and cookies.

We’ve also documented how Quilt handles the different [development tasks](../sewing-kit#tasks) it provides dedicated support for:

- Learn how Quilt builds your [packages](./builds/packages.md), [services](./builds/services.md) and [apps](./builds/apps), including lots of detail on how Quilt apps are built for the [browser](./builds/apps/browser.md), [static hosting](./builds/apps/static.md), and [server-side rendering](./builds/app/server.md)
- Learn how Quilt serves your [apps](./developing/apps.md) and [services](./developing/services.md) in development
